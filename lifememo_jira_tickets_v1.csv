Goal:
- Ensure the app does not automatically transmit user data externally.
- v1: iCloud is used only as a manual destination for encrypted backup files (via Files). No auto sync.

Acceptance Criteria:
- No app-initiated network traffic occurs during normal usage flows (record, browse, transcribe, search, settings).
- No CloudKit/auto-sync code paths or UI that imply automatic sync are present.
- Only user-initiated export/backup actions can result in external storage (e.g., user saves backup to iCloud Drive).

Test Steps (Manual):
1. Run with a network proxy (e.g., Proxyman/Charles). Perform: record → stop → browse → open note → run transcription (on-device) → export. Verify no network requests appear.
2. Verify that saving an encrypted backup to iCloud Drive is only possible via explicit user action (Files picker).
3. Static scan: confirm no analytics/ads/crash auto-upload SDKs are enabled for production.

Suggested Automation:
- Add a debug NetworkGuard wrapper to assert/log if unexpected URLSession/NW calls happen.

Notes:
- If any third-party SDK exists, it must be fully disabled for user-data paths in v1."

Goal:
- Unify persistent storage under Application Support.
- Exclude audio (must) and DB/text (prefer) from device backups; provide encrypted manual backup instead.

Acceptance Criteria:
- DB/audio/transcripts/metadata are all stored under Application Support with a single, documented layout.
- Audio directory is excluded from backup.
- DB and transcript/text are excluded from backup (v1 policy).
- If migrating from previous versions, existing user data is migrated without loss.

Test Steps (Manual):
1. Fresh install: create memo + recording + transcript. Verify files are created in expected Application Support paths.
2. Verify backup-exclusion flag is applied to audio and DB/transcript directories (debug screen or resource values).
3. Upgrade simulation: start from old data layout → update → verify all content remains accessible.

Suggested Automation:
- Unit tests for path resolver: always returns Application Support paths.

Goal:
- When locked: block viewing UI reliably (App Lock gate).
- DB is strongly protected; recording continues while locked via 'recording-only writable' protection.

Acceptance Criteria:
- While device is locked (or Protected Data unavailable), memo list/detail/search never reveals content; privacy screen is shown.
- Recording continues uninterrupted while locked; resulting audio file is valid and playable.
- DB uses strong file protection (locked access not allowed).
- Recording file uses 'writable while open' protection during recording, then escalates to stronger protection after stop.

Test Steps (Manual):
1. Start recording → lock device for 5 minutes → unlock → stop → verify audio plays fully.
2. While locked, attempt to open app → content is not visible (privacy screen).
3. After stop, verify file protection class/attributes changed as specified (debug check).

Suggested Automation:
- Unit test: after recording stop, file protection is escalated.
- UI test: app resume shows privacy screen when App Lock enabled.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Recording continues in background/lock for long sessions without corruption.
- Interruption events (calls/alarms/Siri) are handled: safe stop/resume with clear state.
- Route changes (AirPods connect/disconnect) do not crash or corrupt recordings.

Test Steps (Manual):
1. Record → lock device for 15/30/60 minutes → unlock → verify audio file integrity.
2. During recording, trigger a phone call/alarm → verify state transitions are correct and user is informed.
3. During recording, connect/disconnect AirPods → verify no crash and recording remains valid.

Goal:
- Define 3 recording quality presets and ensure they are applied to actual recording settings.
- Single source of truth for settings (no UI-only change).

Acceptance Criteria:
- Three presets exist (Storage Saver / Balanced default / High).
- Changing preset changes the produced file characteristics (size/bitrate, etc.).
- Changing settings during a recording does not break; policy is defined (recommended: applies next recording).

Test Steps (Manual):
1. For each preset, record 1 minute and compare file size/metadata differences.
2. Change preset mid-recording; verify behavior matches policy (e.g., next recording uses new preset).

Suggested Automation:
- Unit test: preset-to-recorder-settings mapping.
- Unit test: recorder always reads settings from the unified source at start."

- While backgrounded: keep metering, but UI updates resume on foreground.

Acceptance Criteria:
- In foreground, waveform responds immediately to input loudness changes.
- Background → foreground does not crash or glitch; waveform resumes correctly.
- Meter values are stored while backgrounded and can be rendered on return (per product decision).

Test Steps (Manual):
1. Speak softly/loudly; verify waveform changes accordingly.
